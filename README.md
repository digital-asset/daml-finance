# Contingent Claims

This is a library for modelling contingent claims, i.e. derivatives. Briefly, a derivative is represented by a tree of `Claim`s, which describe the future cashflows between two parties.

The implementation closely follows the papers [[1]](#1), [[2]](#2).

To get started, go to the [quickstart](./QUICKSTART.md), or look in the [test directory](./test/daml/Test/FinancialContract.daml) for an example of how to create and lifecycle contracts.

# Dependencies

There is a dependency on [daml-ctl](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml-ctl).

# Building

First off, you need to build [daml-ctl](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml-ctl) and drop the resulting `daml-ctl-x.x.x.dar` in `lib/`.

You can then build a release version (no tests in the `*.dar`) by running `daml build` in the root directory, or a dev version that includes test from `test`.

Source-code documentation can be generated through `make doc`.

# Releases

We aim to adhere to the 'semantic versioning' scheme. [Upgrading.md](./UPGRADING.md) documents breaking changes across versions.

# Contribution Policy

If you wish to contribute to this project, please contact us first via Github. In future, we do plan to accept external contributions, contingent on the Digital Asset CLA.
