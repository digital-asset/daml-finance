# Daml Finance

Welcome to Daml Finance, a collection of purpose-built libraries to enable rapid development of
enterprise-grade tokenization solutions.

## Why do I need it?

Implementing basic financial concepts like ownership or economic terms of an asset is a complex and
tedious task. By providing common building blocks, Daml Finance increases delivery velocity and
shortens the time-to-market when developing Daml applications.

## Getting started using the library

The [Daml Finance documentation](https://digital-asset.github.io/daml-finance/) provides a number of
options to get started using the library.

The [Daml Finance Reference App](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml-finance-app/) showcases how
the library can be integrated into a fully-fledged Daml application.

To test the CI locally, run the following target:

```script
make ci-local
```

To build the documentation follows the steps [here](./docs/README.md).

### Style
