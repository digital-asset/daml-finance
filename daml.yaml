# If sdk-version or daml-version is changed, please run bin/update-daml-hashes
# to keep shell.nix in sync (CI will notice & fail)
# You need to comment out `daml` from the `buildInputs` list to get your Nix shell to run while you
# update the hashes. The sdk-version refers to the release folder names (or tags) found here:
# https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/releases
# For example 2.9.0-rc1 (in case of a release candidate) or 2.8.0 (for a regular release)
sdk-version: 2.10.0-snapshot.20241106.0
# daml-version is not used by the daml assistant, only by the finance nix config
# It refers to the version number of the files of the release folder.
# For example, if you use a release candidate like:
# https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/releases/tag/v2.9.0-rc1
# the daml-version would be: 2.9.0-snapshot.20240619.12850.0.v0cfddd39
# On the other hand, if you use a regular release like:
# https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/releases/tag/v2.8.0
# the daml-version would simply be: 2.8.0
daml-version: 2.10.0-snapshot.20241101.13047.0.v1e6d5c93

# version is independent of the actual sdk-version. It is used to create an assembly artifact here
# https://digitalasset.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/assembly/daml-finance which is referenced by
# docs.daml.com (in the docs/<sdk-version>/version.json files). The purpose of having an independent
# version number is to allow the release of new assembly versions without waiting for a new SDK
# release. For each new SDK release, we increment the minor version of the assembly.
