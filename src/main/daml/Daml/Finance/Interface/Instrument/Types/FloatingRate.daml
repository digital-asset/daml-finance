data ReferenceRateTypeEnum
  = SingleFixing DateRelativeToEnum
    -- ^ The reference rate is fixed on one observation date. This is usually the case for Libor
    -- and similar reference rates. A DateRelativeToEnum is required to indicate whether the
    -- reference rate will reset relative to the first or the last day of the calculation period.
  | CompoundedIndex DayCountConventionEnum
    -- ^ The reference rate is a regularly (e.g. daily) compounded reference rate, e.g. compounded
    -- SOFR, calculated via an index that is continuously compounded since a specified start date.
    -- This enables efficient calculation using only the index values at the start and at the end of
    -- the calculation period: SOFR_INDEX_END / SOFR_INDEX_START - 1, as described here:
    -- https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/additional-information-about-reference-rates#tgcr_bgcr_sofr_calculation_methodology
    -- The day count convention used for the index calculation (by the index provider) is also
    -- required. For example, in the case of SOFR this is Act360, which is implied by the 360/dc
    -- factor in the formula in the "Calculation Methodology for the SOFR Averages and Index"
    -- section in the link above.
