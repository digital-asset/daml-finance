-- | Describes the attributes of a Callable Bond.
data Callable = Callable
  with
    instrument : InstrumentKey
      -- ^ The instrument's key.
    description : Text
      -- ^ The description of the bond.
    floatingRate : Optional FloatingRate
      -- ^ A description of the floating rate to be used (if applicable).
    couponRate : Decimal
      -- ^ The fixed coupon rate, per annum. For example, in case of a "3.5% p.a coupon" this should
      --   be 0.035. This can also used as a floating coupon spread. For example, in case of
      --   "3M Libor + 0.5%" this should be 0.005.
    capRate : Optional Decimal
      -- ^ The maximum coupon rate possible. For example, if "3M Libor + 0.5%" would result in a
      --   rate of 2.5%, but capRate is 2.0%, the coupon rate used would be 2.0%.
    floorRate : Optional Decimal
      -- ^ The minimum coupon rate possible. For example, if "3M Libor + 0.5%" would result in a
      --   rate of -0.2%, but floorRate is 0.0%, the coupon rate used would be 0.0%.
    couponSchedule : PeriodicSchedule
      -- ^ The schedule for the periodic coupon payments. The coupon is paid on the last date of
      --   each schedule period.
      --   In case of a floating rate, the reference rate will be fixed in relation to this schedule
      --   (at the start/end of each period, as specified by FloatingRate).
      --   This is the main schedule of the instrument, which drives both the calculation and the
      --   payment of coupons. It also defines the issue date and the maturity date of the bond.
    callSchedule : PeriodicSchedule
      -- ^ The bond is callable on the last date of each schedule period. For example, if this
      --   schedule is the same as the periodicSchedule, it means that the bond can be called on
      --   each coupon payment date.
    noticeDays : Int
      -- ^ The number of business days in advance of the coupon date that the issuer must give
      --   notice if it wants to call the bond. The election whether to call or not to call must be
      --   done by this date.
    holidayCalendarIds : [Text]
      -- ^ The identifiers of the holiday calendars to be used for the coupon schedule.
    calendarDataProvider : Party
      -- ^ The reference data provider to use for the holiday calendar.
    dayCountConvention : DayCountConventionEnum
      -- ^ The day count convention used to calculate day count fractions. For example: Act360.
    useAdjustedDatesForDcf : Bool
      -- ^ Configure whether to use adjusted dates (as specified in *businessDayAdjustment* of the
      --   *couponSchedule*) for day count fractions.
    currency : InstrumentKey
      -- ^ The currency of the bond. For example, if the bond pays in USD this should be a USD cash
      --   instrument.
    notional : Decimal
      -- ^ The notional of the bond. This is the face value corresponding to one unit of the bond
      --   instrument. For example, if one bond unit corresponds to 1000 USD, this should be 1000.0.
    lastEventTimestamp : Time
      -- ^ (Market) time of the last recorded lifecycle event. If no event has occurred yet, the
      --   time of creation should be used.
    prevEvents : [EventData]
      -- ^ A list of previous events that have been lifecycled on this instrument so far.
