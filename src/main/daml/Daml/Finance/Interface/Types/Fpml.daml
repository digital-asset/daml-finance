    --   of the stream.

  indexTenor : Optional Period
    -- ^ The ISDA Designated Maturity, i.e. the tenor of the
    --   floating rate.
  -- floatingRateMultiplierSchedule : Optional Schedule
    -- ^ A rate multiplier or multiplier schedule to apply to
    --   the floating rate. A multiplier schedule is expressed
    --   as explicit multipliers and dates. In the case of a
    --   schedule, the step dates may be subject to adjustment
    --   in accordance with any adjustments specified in the

    --   schedule, the step dates may be subject to adjustment
    --   in accordance with any adjustments specified in
    --   calculationPeriodDatesAdjustments. The spread is a
    --   per annum rate, expressed as a decimal. For purposes
    --   of determining a calculation period amount, if
    --   positive the spread will be added to the floating
    --   rate and if negative the spread will be subtracted
    --   from the floating rate. A positive 10 basis point
    --   (0.1%) spread would be represented as 0.001.
  -- rateTreatment : Optional RateTreatmentEnum
    -- ^ The specification of any rate conversion which needs
    --   to be applied to the observed rate before being used
    --   in any calculations. The two common conversions are
    --   for securities quoted on a bank discount basis which
    --   will need to be converted to either a Money Market
    --   Yield or Bond Equivalent Yield. See the Annex to the
    --   2000 ISDA Definitions, Section 7.3. Certain General
    --   Definitions Relating to Floating Rate Options,
    --   paragraphs (g) and (h) for definitions of these
    --   terms.
  -- capRateSchedule : [StrikeSchedule]
    -- ^ The cap rate or cap rate schedule, if any, which
    --   applies to the floating rate. The cap rate (strike)
    --   is only required where the floating rate on a swap
    --   stream is capped at a certain level. A cap rate
    --   schedule is expressed as explicit cap rates and dates
    --   and the step dates may be subject to adjustment in
    --   accordance with any adjustments specified in
    --   calculationPeriodDatesAdjustments. The cap rate is
    --   assumed to be exclusive of any spread and is a per
    --   annum rate, expressed as a decimal. A cap rate of 5%
    --   would be represented as 0.05.
  -- floorRateSchedule : [StrikeSchedule]
    -- ^ The floor rate or floor rate schedule, if any, which
    --   applies to the floating rate. The floor rate (strike)
    --   is only required where the floating rate on a swap
    --   stream is floored at a certain strike level. A floor
    --   rate schedule is expressed as explicit floor rates
    --   and dates and the step dates may be subject to
    --   adjustment in accordance with any adjustments
    --   specified in calculationPeriodDatesAdjustments. The
    --   floor rate is assumed to be exclusive of any spread
    --   and is a per annum rate, expressed as a decimal. A
    --   floor rate of 5% would be represented as 0.05.
  -- initialRate : Optional Decimal
    -- ^ The initial floating rate reset agreed between the
    --   principal parties involved in the trade. This is
    --   assumed to be the first required reset rate for the
    --   first regular calculation period. It should only be
    --   included when the rate is not equal to the rate
    --   published on the source implied by the floating rate
    --   index. An initial rate of 5% would be represented as
    --   0.05.
  -- finalRateRounding : Optional Rounding
    -- ^ The rounding convention to apply to the final rate
    --   used in determination of a calculation period amount.
  -- averagingMethod : Optional AveragingMethodEnum
    -- ^ If averaging is applicable, this component specifies
    --   whether a weighted or unweighted average method of
    --   calculation is to be used. The component must only be
    --   included when averaging applies.
  -- negativeInterestRateTreatment : Optional NegativeInterestRateTreatmentEnum
    -- ^ The specification of any provisions for calculating
    --   payment obligations when a floating rate is negative
    --   (either due to a quoted negative floating rate or by
    --   operation of a spread that is subtracted from the
    --   floating rate).

    --   A list of steps may be ordered in the document by
