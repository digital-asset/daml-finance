-- | An interface to manage and control business time. Controlled time rules (i.e. clocks) are
-- managed by entities that have control certain business time events. These can be trading-open /
-- -close on an exchange, start-of-day / end-of-day events of a trading desk, or just a daily
-- clock tick to signal the passing of aticking. Intervals in which
-- the clock "ticks" don't have to be regular, and can e.g. consider business days only.
