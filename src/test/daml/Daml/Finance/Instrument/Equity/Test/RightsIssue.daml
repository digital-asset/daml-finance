  -- The investor can now subscribe by electing to exercise the call option, either in parts

  -- It is also possible to to apply for excess subscription. For example, an investor would
  -- like to subscribe to 150 shares but has regular rights for 100 shares.
  -- In that case, the investor would:
  -- 1. Exercise the call option in whole to subscribe to the guaranteed part (100 shares).
  -- 2. Write a put option for the excess part (50 shares). The issuer (or custodian) could
  --    then exercise this in part or in full.
