{-
  This script distributes a bond to investors and showcases how the bond can be lifecycled to
  trigger (and settle) a coupon payment.

  Bond (security) account structure :

     Issuer
       |
      CSD
       |
    Investor

  Cash account structure :

      Central Bank
      /    |     \
    CSD  Issuer  Bank
                   \
                 Investor

  In the "non-atomic" script, the lifecycling and settlement happen in three steps:
    - issuer lifecycles the instrument
    - effects are settled between issuer and CSD
    - effects are settled between CSD and investor(s)

  The last step involves moving cash through an account hierarchy.

  In the "atomic" script, the last two steps are executed atomically.
