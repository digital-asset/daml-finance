{-
  This script distributes a bond to investors and showcases how the bond can be lifecycled to trigger (and settle) a coupon payment.

  Bond (security) account structure :

          Issuer
           |
          CSD
           |
          Investor

  Cash account structure :

          Central Bank
          /     |     \
       CSD   Issuer  Bank
                        \
                      Investor

  The lifecycling and settlement happen in three steps:
    - issuer lifecycles the instrument
    - effects are settled between issuer and CSD
    - effects are settled between CSD and investor(s)

  The last step involves moving cash through an account hierarchy.
