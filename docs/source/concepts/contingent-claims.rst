Contingent Claims is a library for modeling contingent claims, i.e., derivatives, written in the
smart contract language `Daml <https://www.digitalasset.com/developers>`__. Briefly, a derivative is
represented by a tree of ``Claim``\ s, which describe future cashflows between two parties as well
as the conditions under which these cashflows occur.

The library offers life-cycling capabilities, as well as a valuation semantics that maps a claim to
a mathematical expression that can be used for no-arbitrage pricing.

The implementation closely follows the model outlined in the papers [Cit1]_ and [Cit2]_.

To get started, we recommend reading through the :doc:`quickstart <./contingent-claims/quickstart>`
page.

Examples of how to create and lifecycle contracts can be found across the `Daml Finance` library.
