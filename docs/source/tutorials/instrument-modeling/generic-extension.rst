How To Model and Lifecycle Generic Instruments
##############################################

To follow the script used in this tutorial, you can
`clone the Daml Finance repository <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml-finance>`_. In particular,
the file ``src/test/daml/Daml/Finance/Instrument/Generic/Test/Intermediated/BondCoupon.daml`` is the
starting point of this tutorial.

How To Create a Generic Instrument
**********************************

The :doc:`Generic <../../packages/implementations/daml-finance-instrument-generic>` extension
provides a flexible framework to model generic instruments in Daml Finance. It encapsulates the
:doc:`Contingent Claims <../../concepts/contingent-claims>` library, which allows us to model the
economic terms of an instrument.

Define the Claim
================

Consider a fixed rate bond which pays a 4% p.a. coupon with a 6M coupon period. Assume there are two
coupons remaining until maturity: one today and one in 180 days. This could be modeled in the
following way:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/test/daml/Daml/Finance/Instrument/Generic/Test/Intermediated/BondCoupon.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- CREATE_CC_INSTRUMENT_VARIABLES_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- CREATE_CC_INSTRUMENT_VARIABLES_END

Keywords like
:ref:`when <function-contingentclaims-core-claim-when-17123>`,
:ref:`TimeGte <constr-contingentclaims-core-internal-claim-timegte-91610>`,
:ref:`scale <function-contingentclaims-core-claim-scale-79608>` and
:ref:`one <function-contingentclaims-core-claim-one-13168>`
are defined in the :doc:`Contingent Claims documentation <../../concepts/contingent-claims>`.

Now that we have specified the economic terms we can create a generic instrument:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/test/daml/Daml/Finance/Instrument/Generic/Test/Intermediated/BondCoupon.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- CREATE_CC_INSTRUMENT_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- CREATE_CC_INSTRUMENT_END

This will create an instrument containing the
:doc:`Contingent Claims <../../concepts/contingent-claims>` tree on the ledger.

How To Trade and Transfer a Generic Instrument
**********************************************

When you have created a holding on the above instrument it can be transfered to another party. This
is described in :doc:`Getting Started: Transfer <../getting-started/transfer>`.

In order to trade the instrument (transfer it in exchange for cash) you can also initiate a delivery
versus payment with atomic settlement. This is described in
:doc:`Getting Started: Settlement <../getting-started/settlement>`.

How to Process Lifecycle Events
*******************************

On a coupon payment date of the bond instrument above, the issuer will need to lifecycle the
instrument. This will result in a lifecycle effect for the coupon, which can be cash settled. This
is described in detail in :doc:`Getting Started: Lifecycling <../getting-started/lifecycling>`.

How to Redeem a Generic Instrument
**********************************

On the redemption date, both the last coupon and the redemption amount with be paid. This is
processed in the same way as a single coupon payment described above.
