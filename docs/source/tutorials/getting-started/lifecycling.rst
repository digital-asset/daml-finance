Lifecycling
###########

This tutorial introduces the :ref:`lifecycling <lifecycling>` framework of the library with a simple
example. The purpose is to demonstrate how lifecycle rules and events can be used to process a
dividend payment.

We are going to

#. create a new version of the token instrument
#. create the required lifecycle rules
#. create a distribution event
#. process the event to produce the effects from the distribution
#. instruct settlement by presenting a token holding
#. settling the resulting batch atomically

This example builds on the previous :doc:`Settlement <settlement>` tutorial script such that the
same accounts and existing holdings can be used.

Overview of the Process
***********************

We first give a high-level outline of the lifecycle process.

+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. Create a lifecycle rule                      | A lifecycle rule implements the logic to calculate effects for a given lifecycle event. |
|                                                 | In our example we create a distribution rule to handle the dividend event on our token. |
|                                                 |                                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. Create a lifecycle event                     | The lifecycle event refers to the *target instrument* the event applies to. Holdings on |
|                                                 | this instrument can then be used to claim the resulting lifecycle effect.               |
|                                                 |                                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. Process the event through the lifecycle rule | The lifecycle rule contains the business logic to derive the lifecycle effects          |
|                                                 | resulting from a concrete event. The effect describes the per-unit holding transfers    |
|                                                 | that are to be settled between a custodian and the owner of a holding.                  |
|                                                 |                                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. Claim the effect using a holding             | The claim rule is used to claim the effects resulting from a lifecycle event using a    |
|                                                 | holding on the target instrument. The result is a set of settlement instructions and    |
|                                                 | corresponding batch to be settled between the custodian and owner of the holding.       |
|                                                 |                                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Run the Script
**************

The code for this tutorial can be executed via the ``runLifecycling`` function in the
``Lifecycling.daml`` module.

The first part executes the script from the previous :doc:`Settlement <settlement>` tutorial to
arrive at the initial state for this scenario.

Then we create a new version of the *token* instrument, which is required for defining the
distribution event. This is the instrument holders will receive when processing the lifecycle event
later in the tutorial.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code-samples/getting-started/daml/Scripts/Lifecycling.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- NEW_VERSION_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- NEW_VERSION_END

A clock is required as an input to the distribution rule to determine if the event is due to be
processed.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code-samples/getting-started/daml/Scripts/Lifecycling.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- CREATE_CLOCK_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- CREATE_CLOCK_END

Next, we create two lifecycle rules:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code-samples/getting-started/daml/Scripts/Lifecycling.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- LIFECYCLE_RULES_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- LIFECYCLE_RULES_END

* The :ref:`Distribution Rule <module-daml-finance-lifecycle-rule-distribution-35531>` defines the
  business logic to calculate the resulting lifecycle effect from a given distribution event. It is
  signed by the `Bank` as a provider.
* The :ref:`Claim Rule <module-daml-finance-lifecycle-rule-claim-99318>` allows a holder of the
  target instrument to claim the effect resulting from the distribution event. By presenting their
  holding they can instruct the settlement of the holding transfers described in the effect.

We then create a distribution event describing the terms of the dividend to be paid.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code-samples/getting-started/daml/Scripts/Lifecycling.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- CREATE_EVENT_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- CREATE_EVENT_END

Now we can process the distribution event using the distribution rule.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code-samples/getting-started/daml/Scripts/Lifecycling.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- LIFECYCLE_EVENT_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- LIFECYCLE_EVENT_END

The result of this is an effect describing the per-unit asset movements to be executed for token
holders. Each holder can now present their holding to *claim* the effect and instruct settlement of
the associated entitlements.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code-samples/getting-started/daml/Scripts/Lifecycling.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- CLAIM_EVENT_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- CLAIM_EVENT_END

As a side-effect of claiming the effect the presented holding is exchanged for the new token
version. This is to prevent a holder from claiming a given effect twice.

In our example of a cash dividend only a single instruction is generated: the movement of cash from
the bank to the token holder. This instruction along with its batch is now settled the usual way, as
described in the previous :doc:`Settlement <settlement>` tutorial.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code-samples/getting-started/daml/Scripts/Lifecycling.daml
  :language: daml
  :start-after: -- EFFECT_SETTLEMENT_BEGIN
  :end-before: -- EFFECT_SETTLEMENT_END

Note that the bank in this case does not actually transfer the cash from another account, but simply
credits Bob's account by using the ``CreditReceiver`` allocation type. In a real-world dividend
scenario one would additionally model the flow of funds from the issuer to the bank using the same
lifecycle process as described above.

Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

Which party should create and sign the lifecycle rules and events?
==================================================================

In the simplified scenario for this tutorial we have used the bank as both the *issuer* and
*depository* for the instruments involved. In a real-world case instruments and their corresponding
lifecycle rules and events would be maintained by an actual issuer, with the depository acting as a
3rd-party trust anchor.

Which parties typically take which actions in the lifecycle workflow?
=====================================================================

The lifecycle interfaces governing the process leave the controllers of the various choices in the
process up to the implementation.

* Typically, we would expect the issuer of an instrument to be responsible to generate lifecycle
  events (for example, announcing dividends or stock splits).
* Lifecycle rules on the other hand are often controlled by 3rd-party calculation agents.
* The claiming of lifecycle effects is by default the responsibility of the owner of a holding. If
  instead the owner wants to delegate this responsibility to their custodian they can do so via a
  delegation contract.
* The party executing settlement can be chosen as well, as described in the previous tutorial on
  :doc:`Settlement <settlement>`.

Can an instrument act as its own lifecycle rule?
================================================

Yes, an instrument can implement the ``Lifecycle`` interface directly such that the lifecycle rules
are contained within the instrument itself. An example for this can be found in the implementation
for generic instruments. There are, however, advantages to separating this logic out into rule
contracts:

* Keeping lifecycle rules in a different package from your instruments allows you to independently
  upgrade or patch them without affecting your live instruments.
* Having separate rules allows to change the lifecycle properties of an instrument dynamically at
  runtime. For example, an instrument can initially be created without support for doing asset
  distributions. Then, at a later point the issuer might decide to start paying dividends. They can
  now simply add a distribution rule to the running system to enable this new lifecycle event for
  their instrument without affecting the actual live instrument itself (or any holdings on it).

Summary
*******

You have now learned how to use lifecycle rules and events to describe the behavior of an
instrument. The key concepts to take away are:

* Lifecycle events represent different ways of how an instrument can evolve.
* A lifecycle rule contains logic to calculate the effects an event has on an instrument and its
  holdings.
* A claim rule is used to instruct settlement for a given effect using a holding.
