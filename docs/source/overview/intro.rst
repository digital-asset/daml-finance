Introduction
############

Purpose
*******

Daml Finance supports the modeling of financial and non-financial use cases in Daml. It provides
a standard way to represent assets on Daml ledgers and defines common behaviours and rules.
There are two main benefits to using the library in your application:

* Shortened time-to-market

   Implementing basic financial concepts like ownership or economic terms of an asset is a complex
   and tedious task. By providing common building blocks, Daml Finance increases delivery velocity
   and shortens the time-to-market when building Daml applications. The rich set of functionality of
   Daml Finance is at your disposal so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

* Application composability

   Building your application on Daml Finance makes it compatible with other platforms in the
   wider ecosystem. By using a shared library assets become "mobile", allowing them to be used
   seamlessly across application boundaries without the need for translation or integration layers.
   For instance, a Daml Finance-based asset that is originated in a bond issuance application can be
   used in the context of a secondary market trading application that is also built on Daml Finance.

Design Goals
************

Daml Finance optimizes for the following aspects:

* Accessibility

   The library is designed to have a low barrier to entry. Users familiar with Daml can get started
   quickly and leverage the provided functionality easily.

* Maintainability

   Building with Daml Finance decouples your application code from the underlying representation of
   assets. This allows the application to evolve without the need to migrate assets from one version
   to another, and makes maintenance easier.

* Extensibility

   Various extension points allow customization and extension of the library as required. If an
   existing implementation does not fulfil the requirements it is straightforward to provide a
   custom extension.

Scope
*****

The library covers the following areas:

* Holdings: modeling of ownership structures, custodial relationships, intermediated securities, and
  accounts
* Instruments: structuring the economic terms of an asset and the events that govern its evolution
* Settlement: executing complex transactions involving multiple parties and assets
* Lifecycling: governing the evolution of financial instruments over their lifetime

Use Cases
*********

Daml Finance comes with broad asset and workflow capabilities to allow for a variety of use cases to
be modeled:

* Simple tokens: digital representation of traditional assets
* Central bank digital currency: retail or wholesale distribution models
* Standard asset classes: equities with corporate actions, bonds with flexible cash flow modeling
* Derivatives: time- and path-dependent derivatives with optionality
* Synchronized lifecycling: atomic, intermediated lifecycling and settlement of cash flows across
  investors and custodians
* Cross-entity issuance: atomic, multi-party issuance across investors, issuer, risk book, and
  treasury
* Asset-agnostic trading facility: generic delivery-vs-payment and immediate, guaranteed settlement
* Exotic asset types: non-fungible and non-transferable assets

Exploring the Library
*********************

If you want to review the Daml Finance codebase in more detail you can clone `the repository
<https://github.com/digital-asset/daml-finance>`_ locally on your machine. This allows you to
navigate the code, including both the template definitions and the tests. In particular the tests
are useful to show how the library works and how the different components interact with each other.
If you need to view the code for a specific package release, you can check out the `corresponding
tag <https://github.com/digital-asset/daml-finance/tags>`_.

As a pre-requisite, the `Daml SDK <https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/installation.html>`_ needs
to be installed on your machine.

In order to download the repository, open a terminal and run:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone git@github.com:digital-asset/daml-finance.git

This creates a new folder ``daml-finance`` containing the Daml Finance source code. Navigate to the
folder and run

.. code-block:: shell

   make build

This downloads all required packages and builds the project. You can then run

.. code-block:: shell

   daml studio

to open the code editor and inspect the code.
