-- Setup and assumptions:
-- 1. The cash settles via Bank 1 and Bank 2, and the Central Bank (CB),
--    i.e., Buyer -> Bank 1 -> CB -> Bank 2 -> Seller.
-- 2. The security settles via Custodian 1 and Custodian 2, and the Central Security Depository
--    (CSD), i.e., Buyer <- Custodian 1 <- CSD -> Custodian 2 <- Seller.
-- 3. The cash with CB as custodian (i.e., Central Bank Money) settles off ledger, all other cash
--    and securities settle on ledger.
-- 4. The CSD does not need credit/debit its accounts actively, rather this happens as a consequence
--    of transfers of holdings (with CSD as custodian) between Custodian 1 and Custodian 2.
-- 5. The intermediary banks/custodians allocate and approve their instructions with the
--    Buyer/Seller by a direct credit/debit of the Buyer's/Seller's accounts.
-- 6. Buyer and Seller allocate and approve their instructions by pledging holdings and taking
--    delivery to their accounts, respectively.
