# Daml Finance - Code Samples

This folder contains templates for Daml Finance projects that are integrated into the Daml SDK.
The projects can be created using the `daml new` command, e.g.
`daml new quickstart-finance --template quickstart-finance`.

These code samples are documented and used as part of the `Daml Finance` documentation tutorials.

As the documentation assembly is generated as part of our `Daml Finance` library, the code needs to
live in this repository but the code also needs to also be part of the `daml` repository to enable
running the `daml new quickstart-finance` command.

## Updating and testing the project templates

The [getting-started](getting-started/) code and the other code samples are fully replicated
inside the
[daml repository](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/blob/main/templates/BUILD.bazel#L113).
The only exception is the [daml.yaml](getting-started/daml.yaml) file, which is required for both
local testing and for the CI and **must not** be replicated in the daml repository (this file gets
generated based off the [daml.yaml.template](getting-started/daml.yaml.template) file when
processing the daml command).

### Updating the project templates

1. Make the necessary code changes.

2. Upgrade the project dependencies (only if the Daml Finance packages the project depends on change)

    1. Update the *version* in both the [daml.yaml.template](getting-started/daml.yaml.template) and
    the [daml.yaml](getting-started/daml.yaml) files.

    2. Create a new config file in [tutorials-config](tutorials-config/) with the file name
    being the new *version* set in step 1, with a file extension of `.conf`.

        ```{}
        tutorials-config/{version}.conf
        ```

    3. Update the dependencies in the new configuration file as necessary. The format of the file is

        ```{}
        <full_http_url> <dependency_path>
        ```

        where `full_http_url` is the full http url to download the dependency from. `dependency_path` is
        the path and name to install the dependency to, matching what is specified in the
    [daml.yaml.template](getting-started/daml.yaml.template) and
    [daml.yaml](getting-started/daml.yaml) files.

3. Ensure that the code compiles (i.e., run `./get-dependencies.sh && daml build`) and that it gives
the expected results.

4. Push the changes to github and merge to main.

5. In the daml repository, update the Daml Finance
   [configuration](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/tree/main/daml_finance_dep.bzl)
   with the commit containing the change on main (or a subsequent commit) into the `version` field.
   You also must set the hash of the generated tar of the specified commit. In order to get the
   correct hash value to set in the `sha256` field, run the following commands:

   ```
   curl -Lf https://github.com/digital-asset/daml-finance/archive/<commit_id>.tar.gz -o daml-fin.tar.gz
   sha256sum daml-fin.tar.gz
   ```

   The hash is the first column of the output from the command `sha256sum` (the second being the
   filename which was hashed).

### Testing the project templates

6. To test against the daml code base, build the daml repository by running `daml-sdk-head` in the
   root of the repository (this may take a while...).

7. Run `daml-head new quickstart-finance-test --template quickstart-finance` to generate the
   quickstarter.

8. Ensure that the quickstarter builds: navigate to the folder generated by the quickstarter
    (i.e., `quickstart-finance-test\`) and run `./get-dependencies.sh && daml-head build`.

9. Test the quickstarter code: run `daml-head test` as
well as `daml-head start` to ensure the Sandbox can be started successfully.

10. Remove the created quickstart directory (i.e., `quickstart-finance-test\`) once testing is
    complete.

11. Repeat steps `7` to `11` for all other project templates

12. Raise a PR against the `main` Daml branch and ask the daml team to approve the PR.

13. If applicable, backport the PR merged in step `12` to the target release line branch.
